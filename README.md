## üåü Overview

**Conscious 3D Agent AI** is an interactive, browser-based simulation that brings together **reinforcement learning (RL)**, **3D game mechanics**, and a novel **"consciousness" model** inspired by sheaf theory and integrated information theory (IIT). Watch two AI agents‚Äîa Main AI and an Opponent AI‚Äînavigate a procedurally generated 3D world, competing to collect targets while avoiding obstacles. The system visualizes their internal decision-making, neural network activity, and abstract "qualia" in real-time, offering a unique window into synthetic cognition.

This project is ideal for AI researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in **explainable AI (XAI)**, **machine consciousness**, and **embodied cognition**. It‚Äôs a fully client-side, self-contained demo requiring no backend or complex setup‚Äîjust open `index3.html` in a modern browser!

### üéØ Key Features

- **üéÆ Dual-AI Competition**: Two independent AI agents navigate a 3D environment, using raycasting to detect obstacles and pursue glowing targets.
- **üß† Ontological World Model (OWM)**: Each AI uses an LSTM-based actor-critic model integrated with an **Enhanced Qualia Sheaf** to predict states and make decisions.
- **üåå Qualia Sheaf**: A mathematical structure modeling "consciousness" via qualia diffusion, topological adaptation, and metrics like Œ¶ (integrated information), Gestalt Unity, and H¬π dimension.
- **üìä Live Visualizations**:
  - **3D Environment**: Real-time Three.js rendering of agents, targets, and obstacles.
  - **Neural Networks**: Glowing neurons/connections showing layer activations (Input, Cell State, Hidden State, Q-Values).
  - **Sheaf Graph**: Dynamic 2D graph of conceptual nodes (e.g., Agent-X, Target-Dist) with pulsing activity and weighted edges.
  - **Performance Charts**: Track average state value, prediction error, exploration rate (epsilon), and score difference.
  - **Live2D Avatar** (planned): Emotional expressions tied to qualia states.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Meta-Learning**: A `StrategicAI` layer tunes learning rates and exploration dynamically based on performance and qualia metrics.
- **üî¨ Interactive Controls**: Toggle simulation, step, fast-forward, reset, or tune sheaf parameters (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥) via buttons and sliders.

## üß© How It Works

The simulation orchestrates a cognitive loop where each AI perceives, decides, acts, and learns in a 3D world. Below is a breakdown of the core components and their interactions.

### Cognitive Cycle
1. **Perceive**: Agents gather 13D state vectors (agent/target positions, rotations, raycast distances, opponent data).
2. **Diffuse Qualia**: The `EnhancedQualiaSheaf` processes 8 core state elements (e.g., Agent-X, Dist-Target) into 7D qualia vectors (Being, Intent, etc.), updating a topological graph.
3. **Attend**: An attention mechanism weights raw state and qualia inputs for focus.
4. **Predict**: An LSTM predicts action probabilities (via actor head) and next states (via state prediction head).
5. **Act**: Epsilon-greedy policy selects actions (Move Forward, Turn Left, Turn Right, Idle).
6. **Learn**: Actor-critic RL updates weights using rewards (target collection + curiosity bonus) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss.
7. **Modulate**: `StrategicAI` adjusts learning rate and epsilon based on rewards and sheaf metrics.

### Key Metrics
- **Œ¶ (Integrated Information)**: Measures system coherence (IIT-inspired).
- **Free Energy**: Combines prediction error and model complexity (Free Energy Principle).
- **H¬π Dimension**: Topological complexity of the sheaf graph (via Betti numbers, GF(2)).
- **Gestalt Unity**: Coherence of qualia across graph nodes.
- **Gluing Inconsistency**: Internal contradictions in qualia projections.

### Notes
- **Demo URL**: Replace `your-username.github.io` with your actual GitHub Pages URL after deploying.

- **Testing**: Before publishing, test the README rendering on GitHub and ensure all links (e.g., LICENSE, demo) are valid.

If you want further tweaks (e.g., specific sections, screenshots, or a GitHub Pages setup guide), let me know!
